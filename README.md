# Unity-Useless-Folder-Cleaner

This release includes a handy .bat script designed to streamline the process of cleaning up a Unity project before archiving. By removing unnecessary files and folders, this script reduces project size and prepares it for simpler storage or transfer.

### Features:
Deletes temporary files, build caches, and other non-essential data.
Retains only the core Assets, Packages, and Project Settings needed to rebuild the project.
Optimizes project size, making it more manageable for archiving and sharing.

### Usage:
[Download](https://github.com/Theo-Mestre/Unity-Useless-Folder-Cleaner/releases/tag/v1.0) the .bat file. <br />
Place it in your Unity project folder. <br />
Run the script to automatically clean up unneeded files. <br />
If the script doesn't run right after closing Unity, wait a few seconds for the engine to fully shut down.


> **Note:** The cleaner will permanently delete files. If you want to modify the files, ensure you have backed up your project before running the cleaner.
